# Challenge-1

In this repo, I cleaned up an existing pair of index html and css file for the intend to make the website more accessible. Here's a few things that I did:

1. Updated divs with the more specific ones such as nav, section, article, header, footer.

2. Updated the link for nav bar so it links to the correct section.

3. Regroup the sections and rename them so I can remove the repetitive css lines and apply one set of css code for the entire section.

4. Added comment to the changes that I made.
